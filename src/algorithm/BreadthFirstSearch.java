/*We look for elements or we traverse from left to right at all level
 * It uses additional memory as we track all the node and it's child node on a given level.
 * Ex:       9
 *      4        20
 *    1   6    15  170
 *    
 *    BFS: [9,4,20,1,6,15,170]
 *    
 *    BIG O -> Time complexity O(n) As they go to node at least once.
 *    BFS has shortest path closer to Nodes. But More Memory
 *    BFS is better if we have additional info about the node and if its close to the root node then its good choice
