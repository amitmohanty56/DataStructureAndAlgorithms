Factors to Choose a DataStructure:
1. What kind of data needs to be stored?
2. Cost of Operation 
ex: minimize the cost of frequent operation. 
if we use list data structure then we will make it sort so that we can apply binary search operation.which will reduce the cost of operation.
3. Memory Usage
4. Ease of Implementation.



//#1 - Sort 10 schools around your house by distance:  Insertion as number of input is small so we need something simple.

//#2 - eBay sorts listings by the current Bid amount: radix or counting sort. As these are numbers with fixed range 

//#3 - Sport scores on ESPN: Quick Sorted. because better space complexity.

//#4 - Massive database (can't fit all into memory) needs to sort through past year's user data : Merge Sort. as we will use external space and performance matters.

//#5 - Almost sorted Udemy review data needs to update and add 2 new reviews: Insertion sort

//#6 - Temperature Records for the past 50 years in Canada: Quick Sort.we can do in memory space.

//#7 - Large user name database needs to be sorted. Data is very random. Quick Sort

//#8 - You want to teach sorting for the first time: bubble and selection sort.

* Radix and counting sorting only work with integer and with a fixed range.

* Why we don't put complex data in the list?
We get O(log N) while searching.
*Why we don't put complex data HashTables?
HashTables aren't ordered.
